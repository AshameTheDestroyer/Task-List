# Task-List
A better version of the To Do Application project.

This version includes tons of new features, sucha folders, that hold their own tasks within, and have their own unique settings, for now it's only the colour of the folder that's configurable, and each task within the folder will be affected by its folder's settings.

MessageBox being interoduced too within the project, which's used to change tasks' title, and description, also may warn the user from deleting a task or folder unintentionally.

SettingsWindow too being interoduced, which's used tp configure and display folders' settings, sucha tasks, complete and left tasks, and colour.
